## üìà Statistics, Outliers, Trends, etc.

In this section, we present statistical insights, focusing on metrics like mean and median streaming counts, while identifying outliers and trends to uncover significant patterns in listener behavior and streaming performance.

### üìè General Statistics
This will display the general statistics of the table (streams not included, as it is analyzed in the other section)

```python
spotify.describe()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdba8f0-ae2a-4fcd-9a23-a150490abff7)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3255a324-6872-42a8-bf31-237f62193a55)


### „ÄΩÔ∏è STREAM STATISTICS: Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation

```python
# Calculate for the statistics
mean = round(np.mean(spotify['streams']),2)
median = spotify['streams'].dropna().median()
std = round(np.std(spotify['streams']),2)

print(f"STREAM STATISTICS:\n\nMean: {mean}\nMedian: {median}\nStandard Deviation: {std}")
```

Output:
```python
STREAM STATISTICS:

Mean: 514137424.94
Median: 290530915.0
Standard Deviation: 566559151.83
```

### üìÖ Released Year and Artist Count Distribution Statistics

This will count the occurrences of each release year and artists count

```python
year_counts = spotify['released_year'].value_counts().sort_index()
artist_count_distribution = spotify['artist_count'].value_counts().sort_index()
```

Plotting the distribution of tracks by released year

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
year_counts.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Distribution of Tracks by Released Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77014e2e-9c96-4424-9c1b-3221e806840c)

Observed on the data above, there was a large spike of released tracks in year 2022. This shows that the year 2022 has the greatest amount of notable music that were released in that year. At the start of 2014, the popular musics and trends starts to rise

Plotting the distribution tracks by artist count (will use seaborn styles)

```python
sns.set(style="darkgrid", palette="muted", font_scale=1.1)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data=spotify, x='artist_count', binwidth=1, color="lightcoral", edgecolor="black")
plt.title("Distribution of Tracks by Artist Count", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', color='darkred')
plt.xlabel("Number of Artists", fontsize=14, color='gray')
plt.ylabel("Number of Tracks", fontsize=14, color='gray')
plt.xticks(color='gray')
plt.yticks(color='gray')
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d99a04c-569d-4223-bf33-e114f55d4348)

Observed on the data above, the distribution of tracks by artist count was found out that most tracks that were released were made solo. Though, there are still great numbers of tracks that were released with a collaboration with other artists.

## üèÜ Top Performers in Spotify

We highlight the top-performing songs and artists based on streaming figures, exploring the factors contributing to their success and providing a snapshot of the competitive landscape within Spotify's music ecosystem.

### üèÖ Top 5 Songs in Spotify (2023)

To display the top performers in spotify, ensure that there's no null values that will hinder its computation. Therefore:

```python
spotify['streams'] = pd.to_numeric(spotify['streams'].astype(str).str.replace(',', ''), errors='coerce')
top_5_streams_df = spotify.sort_values(by='streams', ascending=False).head(5).reset_index(drop=True)
top_5_streams_df
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5a36d1-6303-4433-8822-6a2124a0b2c8)

On the table, Blinding lights by the Weeknd has 3 billion streams on spotify and is at spotify charts 69 times

### ‚≠ê Top 5 Most Frequent Artist

```python
top_artists = spotify['artist(s)_name'].str.split(', ').explode().value_counts().head(5)
top_artists_df = top_artists.reset_index()
top_artists_df.columns = ['Artist', 'Track Count']

top_artists_df
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe03c9f-2c8a-4c33-ab69-e0ab37d1e123)

Leading artist was Bad Bunny having 40 tracks in the spotify popular lists, second leading is Taylor Swift with 38 tracks in the spotify popular list

## üé∫ Temporal Trends

This section examines temporal trends in music streaming, analyzing how song popularity varies over time. We will also consider attributes such as danceability, valence, energy, BPM, and acousticness to understand how these characteristics influence listener engagement and streaming figures throughout different periods.

### üì∞ Yearly Trends

Plot the number of tracks by release year with seaborn styling

```python
# Number of tracks by release year
tracks_per_year = spotify['released_year'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Plotting the trend over time
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
tracks_per_year.plot(kind='bar', color='teal')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.title('Distribution of Tracks by Released Year')
plt.show()
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a9ac8cf-892c-4ff5-aaed-9ea1316a5677)

Theres a significant trend of popular music that arisen back in year 2022

Grouping the musical characteristics and plotting it in a line graph for correlations

```python
# Group by released_year and calculate the average of each musical attribute
attributes_by_year = spotify.groupby('released_year')[['danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'acousticness_%', 'valence_%']].mean()

# Plotting trends for each attribute
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for attribute in attributes_by_year.columns:
    plt.plot(attributes_by_year.index, attributes_by_year[attribute], label=attribute)

plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Average Value')
plt.title('Yearly Average of Musical Attributes')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eddde384-a137-4db2-ba35-aad20d0cd2b3)

As year goes by, there 4 musical attributes are fighting for trends, as of 21th century, the leading characteristics are danceability and energy

### üïì Monthly Trends

Counting values in the released_month and plotting it inside the bar graph

```python
# Count the number of tracks by release month
tracks_per_month = spotify['released_month'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Plotting the trend by month
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
tracks_per_month.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks')
plt.title('Distribution of Tracks by Release Month')
plt.xticks(ticks=range(12), labels=['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015ed737-5ea9-4c64-8671-c086c59e5747)

Based on the observed pattern, there has been a boom of popular music when its the month of January and May

Grouping attributes by months released and plotting it in a line graph

```python
# Group by released_month and calculate the average of each musical attribute
attributes_by_month = spotify.groupby('released_month')[['danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'acousticness_%', 'valence_%']].mean()

# Plotting trends for each attribute
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
for attribute in attributes_by_month.columns:
    plt.plot(attributes_by_month.index, attributes_by_month[attribute], label=attribute)

plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Average Value')
plt.title('Monthly Average of Musical Attributes')
plt.legend()
plt.xticks(ticks=range(1, 13), labels=['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b73bb48-c0e2-405f-ba7b-04e40ca339f5)

Based on the observed graph, there has been a consistent leading of danceability and energy as an attribute as months go by


## üé∏ Genre and Music Characteristics

In this section, we analyze the relationship between music genres and their characteristics, focusing on attributes like danceability, valence, energy, BPM, and acousticness. By exploring how these features vary across genres, we aim to uncover trends and preferences that shape streaming success and influence listener choices on Spotify.

### üîÄ Streams and Attributes Correlation

Convert columns to numeric to avoid NaN errors

```python
# Convert columns to numeric, coercing errors to NaN
columns_to_convert = ['streams', 'bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%', 'acousticness_%']
for col in columns_to_convert:
    spotify[col] = pd.to_numeric(spotify[col], errors='coerce')

# Calculate the correlation matrix
corr_matrix = spotify[['streams', 'bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%', 'acousticness_%']].corr()

# Set a dark style for the heatmap
sns.set(style="dark", font_scale=1.2)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap="coolwarm", linewidths=0.5, linecolor="black",
            annot_kws={"size": 12, "color": "black"}, cbar_kws={"shrink": 0.8})
plt.title("Correlation Heatmap of Musical Attributes and Streams", fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', color='lightblue')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right', color='gray')
plt.yticks(rotation=0, color='gray')
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed151aa5-cad3-454b-889f-b8f346855d4d)

In the heatmap that was constructed almost every attributes has negative correlation when its related to streams, meaning, characteristics has nothing to do with popularity because of the difference of preferences by other people

Plotting the correlations of streams and musical attributes to a scatterplot graph using seaborn

```python
# Scatter plots with Streams and additional attribute Valence
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(24, 5))

# Streams vs Danceability
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[0], x='danceability_%', y='streams', data=spotify)
axes[0].set_title("Streams vs Danceability %")

# Streams vs BPM
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[1], x='bpm', y='streams', data=spotify)
axes[1].set_title("Streams vs BPM")

# Streams vs Energy
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[2], x='energy_%', y='streams', data=spotify)
axes[2].set_title("Streams vs Energy %")

# Streams vs Valence
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[3], x='valence_%', y='streams', data=spotify)
axes[3].set_title("Streams vs Valence %")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeff98f6-243e-41e7-9196-fe1ca2144546)


On the scatterplot that was constructed, there's no significant correlation of how different attributes should be to boost the count of streams on music, it is not correlated on how a music is going to be popular. This discovery has made a realization that it does not matter what characteristics in music a piece of good music should be

### ‚öõ Attributes Correlation

Plotting attributes in the scatterplot graph with seaborn styling

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))

# Danceability vs Energy
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[0], x='danceability_%', y='energy_%', data=spotify)
axes[0].set_title("Danceability % vs Energy %")

# Valence vs Acousticness
sns.scatterplot(ax=axes[1], x='valence_%', y='acousticness_%', data=spotify)
axes[1].set_title("Valence % vs Acousticness %")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412d41b4-b1ee-443b-a3f8-1a12491ea2df)

There has been a good correlation when the comparison of danceability and energy takes place. Valence and acousticness almost has no correlation with each other as they are independent. An increase of danceability factor also increases the energy level of a music and vice versa


## üìª Platform Popularity, Patterns, and Consistency

This section explores the popularity and performance of Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer, analyzing user engagement patterns and consistency in streaming behaviors across these platforms. We will highlight key notes, such as major and minor trends, as well as frequently streamed artists, to uncover how these platforms differ in their appeal and user preferences within the music streaming landscape.

### üíæ Platform Comparison

Ensure that there will be no NaN errors by converting columns to numeric; plotting a successful data on a bar graph

```python
# Attempt to convert columns to numeric, setting errors='coerce' to convert non-numeric values to NaN
columns_to_convert = ['in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists', 'in_deezer_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts']
spotify[columns_to_convert] = spotify[columns_to_convert].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

# Sum of tracks on different platforms
platform_data = spotify[columns_to_convert].sum().reset_index()
platform_data.columns = ['Platform', 'Count']

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.barplot(data=platform_data, x='Platform', y='Count', hue='Platform', dodge=False, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Number of Tracks by Platform', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Platform', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18ca7030-ec29-4992-80ea-8c7712ad2cf5)


Based on the bar graph that was shown, Spotify playlists have the most popular songs stored among all platforms

### üéπ Keys Distribution

Counting the key distribution on tracks and plotting its frequency on a graph

```python
# Count of tracks by key and mode
key_mode_counts = spotify.groupby(['key', 'mode']).size().reset_index(name='Count')

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(data=key_mode_counts, x='key', y='Count', hue='mode', palette='coolwarm', dodge=False)
plt.title('Distribution of Tracks by Key and Mode', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Key', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Tracks', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.legend(title='Mode', title_fontsize='13', fontsize='11', loc='upper right')
plt.show()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c1ec21d-39dd-42e5-b599-1db57ab6a268)

On the Bar Graph that was plotted, the C# has the most presence in the number of tracks for being either a Minor or Major; while D# is being the least used Minor and A being the least used Major

### üì£ Top 10 Most Frequent Artists on Charts

Plotting the most frequent artist on charts

```python
# Count the occurrences of each artist across all relevant columns
platform_columns = ['in_spotify_playlists', 'in_spotify_charts', 'in_apple_playlists', 'in_apple_charts', 'in_deezer_playlists', 'in_deezer_charts']
artist_counts = spotify.groupby("artist(s)_name")[platform_columns].sum().sum(axis=1).sort_values(ascending=False)

# Select the top 10 most frequently appearing artists in playlists and charts
top_artists = artist_counts.head(10).reset_index()
top_artists.columns = ['Artist', 'Appearances']

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
sns.barplot(data=top_artists, x='Appearances', y='Artist', hue='Artist', dodge=False, palette="coolwarm", legend=False)
plt.title('Top 10 Most Frequently Appearing Artists in Playlists/Charts', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
plt.xlabel('Appearances in Playlists/Charts', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Artist', fontsize=14)
plt.grid(axis='x', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()
```
